Assignment: funcs.h, task B, lab-02

In funcs.cpp write a void function named print_interval(int L,int U) that will accept two integer 
parameters and will print the output as specified in the main lab. Test this function by calling 
it from the main function which should be defined in main.cpp.

This is the header file

IMPORTANT
   .h (include) files should ONLY contain
   prototypes and definitions, not runnable code
